## 🎯 What Does It Do?

RJAutoMover is a powerful file automation tool that watches specified folders and automatically moves files to designated locations based on customizable rules. Perfect for:

- 📂 Organizing downloads automatically by file type.
- 🎬 Managing media files (videos, images, music).
- 📄 Sorting documents as they arrive
- 🔄 Automating repetitive file management tasks
- 🗂️ Keeping workspaces clean and organized

The application runs silently in the background as a Windows service and provides a convenient system tray interface for monitoring and control.

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

RJAutoMover consists of three integrated components:

### 1. **RJAutoMoverService** (Background Service)
- Runs as a Windows service with configurable service account
- Monitors folders based on configured rules
- Processes and moves files automatically
- **Autonomous operation** - can run without tray icon (optional)
- **Persistent activity history** - SQLite database tracks all transfers across sessions
- Handles retries and error recovery
- Memory-optimized with configurable limits
- Accountability-first design - blocks transfers if database writes fail

### 2. **RJAutoMoverTray** (System Tray Application)
- Provides real-time status monitoring via system tray icon
- Shows balloon notifications for file transfer events
- Allows pausing/resuming processing via context menu
- Displays comprehensive information in the About window with multiple tabs:
  - **Transfers Tab** - View recent file transfers with live status updates
  - **Config Tab** - Review current configuration and application settings
  - **Logs Tab** - Browse service and tray logs with filtering and search
  - **System Tab** - View installation location, memory usage, and uptime
  - **.NET Tab** - See build SDK version, runtime info, and NuGet packages
  - **Version Tab** - Check tray and service version information

### 3. **RJAutoMoverConfig** (Configuration Editor)
- Standalone WPF application for editing configuration files
- Visual interface for creating, editing, and managing file rules
- Real-time validation of configuration settings
- Features:
  - **File Rules Management** - Add, edit, duplicate, and delete rules
  - **Application Settings** - Configure timing, memory limits, and logging options
  - **Validation** - Comprehensive validation before saving (folder permissions, path conflicts, extension overlaps)
  - **Service Integration** - Option to automatically restart the service after saving the active config
- Available in Start Menu: "RJAutoMover > Configuration Editor"

**Communication:** Service and Tray components communicate via gRPC over localhost.

**Dynamic Port Discovery:**
- Ports are discovered dynamically at runtime (NOT stored in configuration)
- This prevents conflicts with Windows reserved port ranges (which can change between reboots due to Hyper-V, WSL2, Docker, etc.)
- Preferred starting port: 51000 (outside typical Windows reserved ranges)
- Port discovery files are created at startup:
  - Service writes to: `C:\ProgramData\RJAutoMover\service.port`
  - Tray writes to: `C:\ProgramData\RJAutoMover\tray.port`
- If connection is lost, apps re-read discovery files to handle port changes after restarts

**Tray Autostart:**
- The tray application automatically starts at Windows login for all users
- Uses registry key: `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`
- Automatically created during installation, removed on uninstall
- No batch file wrapper needed - directly launches the executable

---

## ⚙️ Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Operating System:** Windows 10/11 or Windows Server 2016+
- **.NET Runtime:** .NET 10.0 Runtime (included in installer for self-contained builds)
- **Permissions:** Administrator rights for installation

### Installation Steps

1. **Download** [RJAutoMoverSetup.exe](https://github.com/toohighonthehog/RJAutoMover-releases/raw/main/RJAutoMoverSetup.exe)

2. **Run the installer** with administrator privileges (right-click → "Run as administrator")

3. The installer will:
   - Install files to `C:\Program Files\RJAutoMover` (default)
   - Create a default configuration file (`config.yaml`)
   - Install and start the Windows service
   - Create autostart registry entry for tray application (HKLM\...\Run)

4. **Verify installation:** The system tray icon should appear, indicating the service is running

### Service Account Configuration

By default, the service runs under the **Local System** account. For enhanced security or specific folder access requirements, you can configure a custom service account:

1. Open **Services** (services.msc)
2. Find **RJAutoMover Service**
3. Right-click → **Properties** → **Log On** tab
4. Select **"This account"** and enter credentials
5. Ensure the account has:
   - Read/Write permissions to all configured source and destination folders
   - Local login rights
   - Service logon rights

**Important:** If using a domain or local user account, ensure the account has appropriate permissions to access all folders specified in your rules.

### Service Permissions & File Access

**Critical:** RJAutoMover operates under the **service account context**, not the tray application user or the logged-in user. This means:

#### Permission Requirements

The service account (e.g., Local System, NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM, or a custom user account) must have:

- ✅ **Read permissions** on all source folders specified in your file rules
- ✅ **Write permissions** on all destination folders specified in your file rules
- ✅ **Delete permissions** on source folders (files are moved, not copied)
- ✅ **Network access** if using UNC paths (e.g., `\\server\share\folder`)

#### Automatic Validation

The configuration validator checks folder permissions at service startup:

- **Source folders** - Verified for read access
- **Destination folders** - Verified for write access
- **Invalid paths** - Rules with inaccessible folders are flagged as "unworkable"
- **Startup behavior** - Service requires at least one workable rule to start successfully

If the service account lacks permissions to a configured folder, you'll see errors in:
- Service logs (`C:\ProgramData\RJAutoMover\Logs`)
- About window → Config tab (shows rule validation errors)
- About window → Error tab (if service fails to start)

#### Network Folder Access

For network paths (UNC paths like `\\server\share\folder`):

- **Local System account** - Has limited network access; may not work for domain resources
- **Domain account** - Recommended for accessing network shares
- **Local user account** - Cannot access remote network resources

**Best Practice for Network Paths:**
1. Configure service to run as a domain user account
2. Grant the domain user read/write permissions on the network shares
3. Test folder access from the service account context before deployment

#### Permission Troubleshooting

If files aren't moving and logs show access denied errors:

1. **Check service account** - Verify which account the service runs under (Services → RJAutoMover Service → Properties → Log On)
2. **Test folder access** - Use `runas` to simulate service account access
3. **Review folder security** - Right-click folder → Properties → Security → verify service account has appropriate permissions
4. **Check inheritance** - Ensure permissions are inherited to all subfolders if needed
5. **Validate configuration** - Check About window → Config tab for validation warnings

---

## 🔧 Configuration

Configuration is managed through `config.yaml` located at `C:\ProgramData\RJAutoMover\config.yaml`.

### Basic Configuration Structure

```yaml
FileRules:
  - SourceFolder: C:\Users\YourName\Downloads
    Extension: .mp4|.mov|.avi|.mkv
    DestinationFolder: D:\Videos
    ScanIntervalMs: 15000
    IsActive: true
    Name: Video Files
    FileExists: skip
    DateFilter: LA:+10080  # Archive videos not accessed in 7 days

  - SourceFolder: C:\Users\YourName\Downloads
    Extension: .doc|.docx|.xls|.xlsx|.pdf
    DestinationFolder: D:\Documents
    ScanIntervalMs: 5000
    IsActive: true
    Name: Document Files
    FileExists: overwrite
    DateFilter: LM:-60  # Process documents modified in last hour

Application:
  ProcessingPaused: false
  PauseDelayMs: 0
  MemoryLimitMb: 512
  LogFolder: C:\ProgramData\RJAutoMover\Logs
  LogRetentionDays: 7
```

### Configuration Options

#### FileRules Section

| Parameter | Description | Valid Values / Range | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------------------|---------|
| `SourceFolder` | Folder to monitor for files (required) | Any valid folder path | `C:\Users\John\Downloads` |
| `Extension` | File extensions to match (pipe-separated, required) | Extensions with leading dot | `.pdf\|.docx\|.txt` |
| `DestinationFolder` | Where to move matched files (required) | Any valid folder path | `D:\Documents` |
| `ScanIntervalMs` | How often to scan (milliseconds) | `5000` - `900000` (5 sec - 15 min) | `5000` (5 seconds) |
| `IsActive` | Enable/disable this rule | `true` or `false` | `true` |
| `Name` | Friendly name for the rule (required) | Any non-empty string | `"My Documents"` |
| `FileExists` | Action if file exists in destination | `skip` or `overwrite` | `skip` |
| `DateFilter` | Optional date-based filtering (see below) | Format: `TYPE:SIGN:MINUTES` | `LA:+43200` (30 days) |

**FileRule Validation Rules:**

✅ **Required Fields:**
- `SourceFolder` - Must exist and be accessible by service account
- `DestinationFolder` - Must exist and be writable by service account
- `Extension` - Must not be empty
- `Name` - Must not be empty (alphanumeric, hyphens, underscores, and spaces allowed, max 32 characters)

✅ **Name Format:**
- Alphanumeric characters, hyphens (-), underscores (_), and spaces allowed
- Maximum 32 characters
- Example: `"Video Files"`, `"My Documents 2024"`, `"Archive_01"`, `"Backup-Files"`

✅ **Numeric Ranges:**
- `ScanIntervalMs`: 5,000 - 900,000 ms (5 seconds to 15 minutes)

✅ **FileExists Options:**
- `skip` - Skip file if it exists in destination (default, recommended)
- `overwrite` - Replace existing file in destination

✅ **Date Filter (Optional):**
- **Format:** `TYPE:SIGNMINUTES` (single string, no quotes needed)
- **TYPE Options:**
  - `LA` = Last Accessed Time
  - `LM` = Last Modified Time
  - `FC` = File Created Time
- **SIGN Options:**
  - `+` = Older than (files NOT accessed/modified/created in last X minutes)
  - `-` = Within last (files accessed/modified/created within last X minutes)
- **MINUTES Range:** 1 - 5,256,000 (1 minute to 10 years)
- **Examples:**
  - `LA:+43200` = Files NOT accessed in last 43200 minutes (30 days) - archives idle files
  - `LA:-1440` = Files accessed within last 1440 minutes (1 day) - processes recent files
  - `LM:+10080` = Files NOT modified in last 10080 minutes (1 week) - old unchanged files
  - `LM:-60` = Files modified within last 60 minutes (1 hour) - immediate processing
  - `FC:+43200` = Files created more than 43200 minutes ago (30 days) - old files only
  - Empty or omitted = No filter (process all files)
- **Common Values:** 60 (1 hr) • 1440 (1 day) • 10080 (7 days) • 43200 (30 days)
- **Validation:** Format must be exactly `TYPE:SIGNMINUTES` or empty

✅ **Extension Format:**
- Must include leading dot (`.pdf` not `pdf`)
- Must be alphanumeric, 1-10 characters after the dot
- Multiple extensions separated by pipe: `.mp4|.mov|.avi`
- Case-insensitive matching
- **No wildcards allowed** (`*` or `?`)

✅ **Extension Clash Detection:**
- **Same source folder cannot have duplicate extensions across active rules**
- Example: Two active rules with `SourceFolder: C:\Downloads` cannot both use `.pdf`
- This prevents ambiguous file routing
- Inactive rules are excluded from clash detection

✅ **Folder Path Restrictions:**
- **No wildcards allowed** in SourceFolder or DestinationFolder (`*` or `?`)
- Paths must be specific directories, not patterns
- Special variables are allowed: `<InstallingUserDownloads>`, etc.

✅ **Advanced Rule Validations:**

**1. Infinite Loop Prevention (Direct):**
- **A DestinationFolder cannot match any SourceFolder across all rules**
- This prevents infinite processing loops where moved files get picked up again
- Example violation:
  - Rule 1: `SourceFolder: C:\Downloads`, `DestinationFolder: D:\Sorted`
  - Rule 2: `SourceFolder: D:\Sorted`, `DestinationFolder: E:\Archive` ❌ (D:\Sorted is used as both destination and source)
- This validation applies to **all rules** (both active and inactive)

**2. Circular Move Chain Detection (Multi-hop):**
- Detects indirect circular loops across multiple rules
- Example violation:
  - Rule A: `C:\Temp → C:\Archive`
  - Rule B: `C:\Archive → C:\Backup`
  - Rule C: `C:\Backup → C:\Temp` ❌ (Creates circular chain: Temp → Archive → Backup → Temp)
- Uses graph analysis to find chains of any length

**3. Same Source and Destination:**
- SourceFolder and DestinationFolder cannot be identical
- Example violation: `SourceFolder: C:\Temp`, `DestinationFolder: C:\Temp` ❌
- Would cause pointless file operations and potential lock issues

**4. Destination Inside Source (Recursive Growth):**
- DestinationFolder cannot be a subdirectory of SourceFolder
- Example violation: `SourceFolder: C:\Downloads`, `DestinationFolder: C:\Downloads\Archive` ❌
- Would cause infinite growth as moved files remain in monitored directory
- Also checks reverse: Source cannot be inside Destination

**5. Duplicate Rule Names:**
- All rule names must be unique (case-insensitive)
- Example violation: Two rules both named "Documents" ❌
- Ensures clear identification in logs and UI

**6. Reserved Windows Folder Names:**
- Paths cannot contain reserved Windows names
- Reserved names: `CON`, `PRN`, `AUX`, `NUL`, `COM1-9`, `LPT1-9`
- Example violations:
  - `C:\Temp\CON\Files` ❌
  - `D:\Data\PRN` ❌
  - `C:\LPT1\Archive` ❌
- Prevents Windows file system compatibility issues

**7. Case-Insensitive Path Comparison:**
- All path comparisons are case-insensitive (Windows standard)
- `C:\temp` and `C:\TEMP` are treated as the same folder
- Prevents duplicate source folders with different casing

**8. Path Normalization:**
- All paths are normalized using `Path.GetFullPath()` before comparison
- Handles variations like:
  - `C:\Downloads` vs `C:\Downloads\`
  - `C:\Downloads\.` vs `C:\Downloads`
  - Relative paths are converted to absolute paths
- Ensures accurate duplicate and conflict detection

⚠️ **Important Notes:**
- At least one rule must be workable (have valid paths) for configuration to be valid
- Inactive rules (`IsActive: false`) are validated but don't cause configuration failure
- Source and destination folders must be accessible by the service account
- **Extension clashes are only checked for active rules in the same source folder**
- **Loop prevention and circular chain detection applies to ALL active rules**
- All validations occur at service startup - invalid configurations prevent service from starting

⚠️ **Path Aliasing Warning (Advanced):**

If you use **mixed path types** that reference the same physical location, the validator will detect and log warnings:

**Example of path aliasing:**
```yaml
FileRules:
  - Name: Rule1
    SourceFolder: P:\Data          # Mapped drive
    DestinationFolder: D:\Archive

  - Name: Rule2
    SourceFolder: \\server\share   # UNC path to same location as P:\
    DestinationFolder: D:\Backup
```

If `P:\` is mapped to `\\server\share`, the validator will:
1. ✅ **Detect** the aliasing by resolving mapped drives to UNC paths
2. ⚠️ **Log warnings** showing which paths are aliases:
   ```
   Path aliasing detected - multiple paths may reference the same physical location:
     'P:\Data' → '\\server\share\Data' (canonical)
   ```
3. ✅ **Continue validation** using canonical paths to prevent false positives in loop detection

**Best Practice:** Use **consistent path types** across all rules:
- ✅ All UNC paths: `\\server\share\folder`
- ✅ All mapped drives: `P:\folder`, `Q:\folder`
- ❌ Avoid mixing: `P:\folder` AND `\\server\share\folder` in different rules

**Why this matters:**
- Circular chain detection uses canonical paths, so aliases won't cause false loop warnings
- However, at runtime, file monitoring might behave unexpectedly with mixed paths
- Using consistent paths makes configuration clearer and more maintainable

#### Application Section

| Parameter | Description | Valid Range | Default |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|---------|
| `ProcessingPaused` | Start with processing paused | `true` or `false` | `false` |
| `PauseDelayMs` | Delay between file operations | `0` - `60000` ms (0-60 sec) | `0` |
| `MemoryLimitMb` | Memory limit before error mode | `128` - `4096` MB | `512` |
| `LogFolder` | Custom log folder path (optional) | Any valid folder path or empty | System ProgramData folder |
| `LogRetentionDays` | Days to retain log files before cleanup | `1` - `365` | `7` |
| `ActivityHistoryEnabled` | Master switch for activity logging (see below) | `true` or `false` | `true` |
| `ActivityHistoryMaxRecords` | Maximum database records (see below) | `100` - `50000` | `5000` |
| `ActivityHistoryRetentionDays` | Auto-purge records older than X days (see below) | `1` - `365` | `90` |

**Application Configuration Validation Rules:**

✅ **Timing Intervals (all in milliseconds):**
- `PauseDelayMs`: 0 - 60,000 (delay between file operations to throttle processing)

✅ **Resource Limits:**
- `MemoryLimitMb`: 128 - 4,096 MB (service enters error mode if exceeded)

⚠️ **Performance Tips:**
- Lower `ScanIntervalMs` = more responsive but higher CPU usage
- Higher `MemoryLimitMb` = handle more files but use more resources

### Special Folder Variables

Use these variables in folder paths for user-specific locations:

- `<InstallingUserDownloads>` - Downloads folder of the user who installed the application
- `<InstallingUserDocuments>` - Documents folder of the installing user
- `<InstallingUserDesktop>` - Desktop folder of the installing user
- `<SystemLogFolder>` - System ProgramData log folder (used for LogFolder setting)

**Example:**
```yaml
SourceFolder: <InstallingUserDownloads>
DestinationFolder: <InstallingUserDocuments>\Sorted
```

> **Note:** The `<SystemLogFolder>` placeholder is automatically replaced during installation with the system's ProgramData location (e.g., `C:\ProgramData\RJAutoMover\Logs`). If you remove or empty the `LogFolder` setting, the application will use this default location automatically.

### Activity History & Autonomous Operation

- **Location:** `C:\ProgramData\RJAutoMover\Data\ActivityHistory.db`
- **Session tracking** - Each service restart creates a unique session ID
- **Cross-user visibility** - All users can see complete transfer history
- **Automatic cleanup** - Two independent cleanup mechanisms (see below)
- **Accountability** - If database writes fail, transfers are blocked to ensure no "invisible" operations

**Activity History Configuration Settings:**

1. **ActivityHistoryEnabled** (default: `true`)
   - Master switch for the activity logging system
   - When `true`: All file transfers are logged to the SQLite database
   - When `false`: No database operations occur, transfer history is not persisted
   - All database methods check this flag before executing
   - If disabled, transfers still occur but are not recorded

2. **ActivityHistoryMaxRecords** (default: `5000`)
   - Limits the total number of records stored in the database
   - Enforced **after every file transfer** via automatic cleanup
   - When the count exceeds the limit, the oldest records (by insertion order) are deleted
   - Prevents unbounded database growth with high transfer volumes
   - Works independently of time-based retention
   - Example: If set to 5000 and transfer #5001 occurs, the oldest record is deleted

3. **ActivityHistoryRetentionDays** (default: `90`)
   - Time-based record purging for historical data
   - Runs **once on service startup** (not continuously)
   - Deletes all records older than the specified number of days
   - Works independently of count-based limit
   - Example: If set to 90, records older than 90 days are deleted when the service starts

**Cleanup Behavior:**
- Both limits (`MaxRecords` and `RetentionDays`) are enforced independently
- Records from the current service session are never purged
- If `ActivityHistoryEnabled` is `false`, no cleanup occurs (database is not accessed)
- Count-based cleanup is real-time (after every insert)
- Time-based cleanup is on-demand (service startup only)

**Autonomous Operation** - The service operates independently:

- ✅ Service moves files automatically without requiring user interaction
- ✅ Works even when no user is logged in
- ✅ All transfers recorded in persistent database
- ✅ Any user who logs in can view full history in tray

**Database Resilience:**
- Automatic corruption detection and backup
- Retry logic for write failures
- Service stops all transfers if database becomes unavailable
- Prevents "invasive actions without record or visibility"

### Editing Configuration

You can edit the configuration in two ways:

#### Option 1: Configuration Editor (Recommended)

1. **Launch** the Configuration Editor from Start Menu: "RJAutoMover > Configuration Editor"
2. **Load** the configuration file (default: `C:\ProgramData\RJAutoMover\config.yaml`)
3. **Edit** file rules and application settings using the visual interface:
   - Add, edit, duplicate, or delete rules
   - Configure application settings with descriptions and validation
4. **Validate** the configuration before saving (checks for errors, conflicts, and permissions)
5. **Save** the configuration - the editor will offer to restart the service automatically if editing the active config

The Configuration Editor provides:
- Real-time folder path validation
- Extension format checking
- Extension overlap detection (prevents duplicate extensions in the same source folder)
- Date filter configuration with explanations
- Permission verification
- Service restart integration

#### Option 2: Manual Editing

1. **Stop the service** (via tray icon or Services)
2. **Edit** `C:\ProgramData\RJAutoMover\config.yaml` in a text editor
3. **Save changes**
4. **Restart the service**

Changes take effect immediately upon service restart.

## 🔄 Version Checking

RJAutoMover includes automatic version checking to notify you when updates are available.

### How It Works

The version checker compares your installed version against the latest release on GitHub:

1. **Version Source:** `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/toohighonthehog/RJAutoMover-releases/main/README.md`
   - The README.md in the releases repository contains a `## Latest Version: X.X.X.X` header
   - This header is automatically added when publishing a release
   - The version checker parses this header to determine the latest released version

2. **Installer URL:** `https://github.com/toohighonthehog/RJAutoMover-releases/raw/main/RJAutoMoverSetup.exe`
   - Direct link to download the latest installer from the public releases repository
   - Displayed in the update notification when a new version is available
   - Hover over the version number in the Version tab to see this URL
   - Ctrl+Click on the version number to download the installer directly

### Version Status Messages

When you open the About window's Version tab, the following messages may appear:

- **"(new version available: X.X.X.X)"** - An update is available (blue hyperlink to installer)
- **"(Latest Version)"** - You're running the current released version (green text)
- **"(Pre-release)"** - You're running a development version newer than the latest release (orange text)
- **"(unable to confirm)"** - Version check failed (network error or timeout) (gray italic text)

### Version Comparison Logic

The version checker uses the following logic:

```
Latest Version (from README.md): 0.9.6.147
Your Installed Version: 0.9.6.146

Comparison:
- If Latest (0.9.6.147) > Installed (0.9.6.146) → Update Available
- If Latest (0.9.6.147) = Installed (0.9.6.147) → Latest Version
- If Latest (0.9.6.147) < Installed (0.9.6.148) → Pre-release
```

### Automatic Refresh

- Version information is checked when the About window is first opened
- **Automatically refreshes** each time you click on the Version tab
- Checks are performed asynchronously without blocking the UI
- 10-second timeout for network requests

### Privacy & Network Usage

- Version checks only occur when you open the About window or switch to the Version tab
- No automatic background version checking
- No telemetry or usage data is sent
- Simple HTTP GET request to GitHub's raw content

dotnet build RJAutoMover.sln -c Release
```

**Publish service, tray, and config editor:**
```powershell
dotnet publish RJAutoMoverService\RJAutoMoverService.csproj -c Release -o installer\publish\service
dotnet publish RJAutoMoverTray\RJAutoMoverTray.csproj -c Release -o installer\publish\tray
dotnet publish RJAutoMoverConfig\RJAutoMoverConfig.csproj -c Release -o installer\publish\config
```

**Create installer:**
```powershell
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Inno Setup 6\ISCC.exe" installer\RJAutoMover.iss
```

The installer will be created as `installer\RJAutoMoverSetup.exe`.

## 📝 Logs & Data

### Logs

Logs are powered by **Serilog** for reliable, high-performance logging with automatic rotation and retention.

**Log Location:** `C:\ProgramData\RJAutoMover\Logs` (or custom path from `config.yaml`)

**Log Files:**
- **Service logs:** `YYYY-MM-DD-HH-mm-ss RJAutoMoverService.log`
- **Tray logs:** `YYYY-MM-DD-HH-mm-ss RJAutoMoverTray.log`
- **Rotated files:** `YYYY-MM-DD-HH-mm-ss RJAutoMoverService_001.log`, `_002.log`, etc.

**Automatic Log Management:**
- ✅ **Automatic rotation** - New log file created every 10MB to prevent oversized files
- ✅ **Automatic cleanup** - Old logs deleted based on `LogRetentionDays` (default: 7 days)
  - Runs on service startup
  - Runs daily at 2:00 AM via background timer
  - Uses `LastWriteTime` to determine file age
  - Protects current session logs (skips files currently in use)
  - **Only removes OLD files** (older than `LogRetentionDays`)
- ✅ **Manual cleanup** - Clear Logs button in tray application
  - Deletes **ALL** log files regardless of age (including current session logs)
  - Available in Logs tab of the About window
- ✅ **Shared file access** - Tray can read Service logs in real-time without locking conflicts
- ✅ **Buffered writes** - Optimized performance with 1-second flush interval

**Log Cleanup vs Activity History Cleanup:**

These are two separate systems with different purposes:

| Feature | Log Cleanup (Automatic) | Log Cleanup (Manual) | Activity History Cleanup (Automatic) | Activity History Cleanup (Manual) |
|---------|------------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **What is cleaned** | Physical log files (.log) | Physical log files (.log) | Database records | Database records |
| **When it runs** | Service startup + daily at 2:00 AM | When user clicks Clear Logs button | Service startup only | When user clicks Clear History button |
| **What gets removed** | Files older than `LogRetentionDays` | **ALL log files** | Records older than `ActivityHistoryRetentionDays` OR exceeding `ActivityHistoryMaxRecords` | All/Previous sessions based on filter selection |
| **Configuration** | `LogRetentionDays` (default: 7 days) | N/A - removes all | `ActivityHistoryRetentionDays` (90 days) + `ActivityHistoryMaxRecords` (5000) | N/A - user controlled |
| **Age detection** | Uses file `LastWriteTime` | N/A - deletes all | Uses record timestamp | N/A - user controlled |
| **Current session** | Protected (skips open files) | Deleted | Protected (never purged) | Can be cleared if "All Sessions" selected |

**Log Contents:**
- File operations (moves, errors, retries)
- Service status changes
- Configuration changes
- Performance metrics
- Error details with stack traces
- gRPC communication (labeled `[gRPC>]` and `[gRPC<]`)

### Activity Database

Persistent activity history is stored in the `Data\` folder:

- **Location:** `C:\Program Files\RJAutoMover\Data\ActivityHistory.db`
- **Format:** SQLite database with WAL mode for crash safety
- **Backed up during upgrades** - Installer automatically preserves database
- **Schema:** Activities table with session IDs, timestamps, file details, and status
- **Corruption handling:** Automatic detection and backup to `.corrupted.{timestamp}.bak`

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Service Won't Start
- Check Windows Event Viewer for error details
- Verify service account permissions
- Check `config.yaml` for syntax errors
- Check port discovery files in `C:\ProgramData\RJAutoMover\` for port binding issues

### Files Not Moving
- Verify source folder exists and is accessible
- Check file extensions match exactly (case-insensitive)
- Ensure destination folder exists and is writable
- Review logs for error messages
- Confirm rule is set to `IsActive: true`

### Permission Errors
- **Remember:** The service runs under the service account context (usually Local System), NOT the logged-in user or tray application user
- Ensure service account has read access to source folders
- Verify write permissions to destination folders
- For network paths, use a domain account with appropriate access
- Check folder ownership and inheritance
- See [Service Permissions & File Access](#service-permissions--file-access) for detailed permission requirements

### High Memory Usage
- Reduce `MemoryLimitMb` in configuration
- Increase `ScanIntervalMs` to reduce polling frequency
- Check for large files causing processing delays
